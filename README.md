# Random-Episode
A GUI desktop app that will get a random episode from a show title the user enters.
This project utilizes an api to retrieve information about a show entered: you need an internet connect for this project to work correctly.
You also need to download wxPython and requests to compile this project.

To download wxPython and requests, go to your terminal or cmd and type in: 
                                                  python -m pip install -U wxPython ,
                                                  python -m pip install -U requests

This project was written in Python 3.6, I don't know if it will work with earlier versions of Python.
